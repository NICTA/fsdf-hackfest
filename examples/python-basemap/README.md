Python/Basemap Examples
=======================

These examples are from Lachlan McCalman's talk on Basemap. They are a series
of decreasingly simple examples of how to quickly generate geospatial plots of
data from various sources. Unfortunately the actual data used in the scripts is
a bit big to add to the repo, but it should be floating around on the day.
