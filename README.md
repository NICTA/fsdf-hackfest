Welcome to Envirohack
=====================

Envirohack is a one-day [hackfest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackfest) for developing software which uses Australian geospatial environmental data sets and servers.

Data sets and services that will be featured on the day include ones from Geoscience Australia,
Department of Environment, Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Meteorology, Australian Bureau of Statistics and CSIRO.

The event is on Friday 29 Nov and is being run by the Australian Federal Government's [Office of Spatial 
Policy (OSP)](http://spatial.gov.au/) and [National ICT Australia (NICTA)](http://www.nicta.com.au/).
This is part of an initiative by [ANZLIC](http://anzlic.org.au) and OSP to build a [Foundation Spatial Data Framework](http://spatial.gov.au/node/124) making it easier for 
companies, government and individuals to access and use government spatial information.  

The event will be held at NICTA labs in Canberra and Sydney (Australian Technology Park) and The Edge in Brisbane.
